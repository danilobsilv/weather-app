<h1>This repository contains the code for a weather application focused on backend features, using free APIs and SQLite3</h1>
<br>
<p>By embarking on this endeavor, I intend to expand my skills in backend development and database management. This project provides an excellent opportunity to gain hands-on experience with various APIs and explore the intricacies of working with SQLite3. As I work on building this weather application, I will gain valuable insights into data retrieval, storage, and processing.</p>
